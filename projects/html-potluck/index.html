        "The delicate balance between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy
        underbelly of Zaun. Tensions between these city-states boil over with 
        the creation of "hextech", a way for any person to control magical 
        energy in Piltover, and in Zaun, a new drug called "shimmer" transforms 
        humans into monsters. The rivalry between the cities splits families and
        friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of 
        League of Legends' famous champions including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce,
        Viktor,and Ekko."

        The series is set on a seemingly infinite train traveling through barron
        wasteland in an alternate dimension. Every car on the train functions as
        idea sideit's own mini-universe which each have their own rules and laws 
        of physics and contain a variety of bizarre and fantastical environments 
        and creatures. The passengers on the train are people it picks up from 
        the real world who have unresolved emotional issues or trauma. As the
        passengers traverse the train's cars, they have adventures solving
        challenges and meeting denizens who help them confront and resolve 
        their past trauma and emotional problems. Their progress is 
        represented by a glowing green number on their hand that goes down
        if they successfully confront and resolve these issues or goes up
        if they fail or backtrack on their progress. Once they resolve 
        their issues, their number reaches zero and a portal opens up
        allowing them to leave the train and return home. Each season
        (referred to as a "book") follows a different character or group
        of characters during their journey of emotional healing and self
        discovery on the train."
