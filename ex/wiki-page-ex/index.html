    <b> crown shynees </b>

    <i> (also company disengagment, compay shyness, or inter-crown spacing)</i>
        is a phennomenon observed in some tree speaciesin which the crowns
        of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
         forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.
          (4l51 The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees
           of the same species,
        but also occurs between trees of different species.
         [6)l7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is
          an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it
        might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.

    The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain I) 
    The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.
     91 The variety of
    hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple
     mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.
      [citation needed]
    Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to
     "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer
      physical damage
    as they collide with each other during winds. As the result of abrasions and
     collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest
      that lateral
    branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by
     mechanical abrasion. '10) If the crowns are artificially prevented from
      colliding in the
    winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps. '11) This explains instances of
     crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this
      idea cite that
    shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning,
     including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession
      forests where branches
    are flexible and limited in lateral movement. [6][12] By this explanation,
     variable flexibility in lateral branches has a large bearing on degree of
      crown shyness.
